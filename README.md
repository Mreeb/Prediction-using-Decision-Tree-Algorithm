# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
# TASK 6
This project implements a Decision Tree classifier algorithm using a dataset of input features and output classes. The main goal is to predict the right class for any new data fed into the classifier. The implementation includes creating the Decision Tree classifier, training it on the dataset, and visualizing the resulting tree structure graphically.

The Decision Tree classifier works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of input features, constructing a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. By visualizing the Decision Tree, we can gain insight into the decision-making process of the algorithm and identify the most important features for classification.

To use the classifier, simply feed it with new data, and it will predict the corresponding output class. The accuracy of the predictions can be measured by comparing the predicted classes with the actual ones from the dataset.

Overall, this implementation provides a useful tool for solving classification problems and understanding the decision-making process of the Decision Tree algorithm.
